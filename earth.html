        <h1>Earth</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Earth - the cosmic equivalent of that one friend who shows up to the party with both water and wine. We're the only known planet to simultaneously host millions of species, including humans who invented both string theory and cheese in a can. Floating through space at a cozy 67,000 mph, we're basically a giant space Tesla with better air conditioning and significantly more dogs.</p>
